To achieve competitive performance on a\\nwide range of objective functions, the possible change rates of the adaptive parameters need\\nto be adjusted carefully. The CMA-ES separately controls change rates for the mean value of\\nthe distribution, m, the covariance matrix, C, and the step-size, σ.\\n• The change rate for the mean value m, relative to the given sample distribution, is\\ndetermined by cm , and by the parent number and the recombination weights. The larger\\nµeff , the smaller is the possible change rate of m.24 Similar holds for most evolutionary\\nalgorithms.'\n",
