	abstract = {In trying to solve multiobjective optimization problems, many traditional methods scalarize the objective vector into a single objective. In those cases, the obtained solution is highly sensitive to the weight vector used in the scalarization process and demands that the user have knowledge about the underlying problem. Moreover, in solving multiobjective problems, designers may be interested in a set of Pareto-optimal points, instead of a single point. Since genetic algorithms (GAs) work with a population of points, it seems natural to use GAs in multiobjective optimization problems to capture a number of solutions simultaneously. Although a vector evaluated GA (VEGA) has been implemented by Schaffer and has been tried to solve a number of multiobjective problems, the algorithm seems to have bias toward some regions. In this paper, we investigate Goldberg's notion of nondominated sorting in GAs along with a niche and speciation method to find multiple Pareto-optimal points simultaneously. The proof-of-principle results obtained on three problems used by Schaffer and others suggest that the proposed method can be extended to higher dimensional and more difficult multiobjective problems. A number of suggestions for extension and application of the algorithm are also discussed.},

The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) is a relatively recent technique for finding or approximating the Pareto-optimal set for multiobjective optimization problems. In different studies SPEA has shown very good performance in comparison to other multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, and therefore it has been a point of reference in various recent investigations. Furthermore, it has been used in different applications. In this paper, an improved version, namely SPEA2, is proposed, which incorporates in contrast to its predecessor a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method. The comparison of SPEA2 with SPEA and two other modern elitist methods, PESA and NSGA-II, on different test problems yields promising results.Other

Each test function involves a particular feature that is known to cause difficulty in the evolutionary optimization process, mainly in converging to the Pareto-optimal front (e.g., multimodality and deception). By investigating these different problem features separately, it is possible to predict the kind of problems to which a certain technique is or is not well suited. However, in contrast to what was suspected beforehand, the experimental results indicate a hierarchy of the algorithms under consideration. Furthermore, the emerging effects are evidence that the suggested test functions provide sufficient complexity to compare multiobjective optimizers. Finally, elitism is shown to be an important factor for improving evolutionary multiobjective search.},

	abstract = {Multiobjective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems can be found in many real-world applications. However, exactly solving these problems would be very challenging, particularly when they are NP-hard. Many handcrafted heuristic methods have been proposed to tackle different MOCO problems over the past decades. In this work, we generalize the idea of neural combinatorial optimization, and develop a learning-based approach to approximate the whole Pareto set for a given MOCO problem without further search procedure. We propose a single preference-conditioned model to directly generate approximate Pareto solutions for any trade-off preference, and design an efficient multiobjective reinforcement learning algorithm to train this model. Our proposed method can be treated as a learning-based extension for the widely-used decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D). It uses a single model to accommodate all the possible preferences, whereas other methods use a finite number of solutions to approximate the Pareto set. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms some other methods on the multiobjective traveling salesman problem, multiobjective vehicle routing problem, and multiobjective knapsack problem in terms of solution quality, speed, and model efficiency.},

	abstract = {The multiobjective evolutionary optimization algorithm (MOEA) is a powerful approach for tackling multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), which can find a finite set of approximate Pareto solutions in a single run. However, under mild regularity conditions, the Pareto optimal set of a continuous MOP could be a low dimensional continuous manifold that contains infinite solutions. In addition, structure constraints on the whole optimal solution set, which characterize the patterns shared among all solutions, could be required in many real-life applications. It is very challenging for existing finite population based MOEAs to handle these structure constraints properly. In this work, we propose the first model-based algorithmic framework to learn the whole solution set with structure constraints for multiobjective optimization. In our approach, the Pareto optimality can be traded off with a preferred structure among the whole solution set, which could be crucial for many real-world problems. We also develop an efficient evolutionary learning method to train the set model with structure constraints. Experimental studies on benchmark test suites and real-world application problems demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Domination-based multi-objective (MO) evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are today arguably the most frequently used type of MOEA. These methods however stagnate when the majority of the population becomes non-dominated, preventing convergence to the Pareto set. Hypervolume-based MO optimization has shown promising results to overcome this. Direct use of the hypervolume however results in no selection pressure for dominated solutions. The recently introduced Sofomore framework overcomes this by solving multiple interleaved single-objective dynamic problems that iteratively improve a single approximation set, based on the uncrowded hypervolume improvement (UHVI). It thereby however loses many advantages of population-based MO optimization, such as handling multimodality. Here, we reformulate the UHVI as a quality measure for approximation sets, called the uncrowded hypervolume (UHV), which can be used to directly solve MO optimization problems with a single-objective optimizer. We use the state-of-the-art gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm (GOMEA) that is capable of efficiently exploiting the intrinsically available grey-box properties of this problem. The resulting algorithm, UHV-GOMEA, is compared to Sofomore equipped with GOMEA, and the domination-based MO-GOMEA. In doing so, we investigate in which scenarios either domination-based or hypervolume-based methods are preferred. Finally, we construct a simple hybrid approach that combines MO-GOMEA with UHV-GOMEA and outperforms both.},

	abstract = {Computer vision (CV) is a big and important field in artificial intelligence covering a wide range of applications. Image analysis is a major task in CV aiming to extract, analyse and understand the visual content of images. However, image-related tasks are very challenging due to many factors, e.g., high variations across images, high dimensionality, domain expertise requirement, and image distortions. Evolutionary computation (EC) approaches have been widely used for image analysis with significant achievement. However, there is no comprehensive survey of existing EC approaches to image analysis. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey covering all essential EC approaches to important image analysis tasks including edge detection, image segmentation, image feature analysis, image classification, object detection, and others. This survey aims to provide a better understanding of evolutionary computer vision (ECV) by discussing the contributions of different approaches and exploring how and why EC is used for CV and image analysis. The applications, challenges, issues, and trends associated to this research field are also discussed and summarised to provide further guidelines and opportunities for future research.},

	abstract = {The hybridization of evolutionary algorithms and local search techniques as, e.g., mathematical programming techniques, also referred to as memetic algorithms, has caught the interest of many researchers in the recent past. Reasons for this include that the resulting algorithms are typically robust and reliable since they take the best of both worlds. However, one crucial drawback of such hybrids is the relatively high cost of the local search techniques since many of them require the gradient or even the Hessian at each candidate solution. Here, we propose an alternative way to compute search directions by exploiting the neighborhood information. That is, for a given point within a population \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{P\}\$\$, the neighboring solutions in \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{P\}\$\$are used to compute the most greedy search direction out of the given data. The method is hence particularly interesting for the usage within population-based search strategies since the search directions come ideally for free in terms of additional function evaluations. In this study, we analyze the novel method first as a stand-alone algorithm and show further on its benefit as a local searcher within differential evolution.},

We first examine the effect of the tournament size to choose good solutions for local search on the performance of MOMAs. Next we examine the effectiveness of an idea of applying local search only to non-dominated solutions in the offspring population. We show that this idea has almost the same effect as the use of a large tournament size because both of them lead to high selection pressures. Then we examine different configurations of genetic operators and local search in MOMAs. For example, we examine the use of genetic operators after local search. In this case, improved solutions by local search are used as parents for recombination while local search is applied to the current population after generation update.},

Such techniques involve penalty parameters which must be set right in order for GAs to work. Although many researchers use adaptive variation of penalty parameters and penalty functions, the general conclusion is that these variations are specific to a problem and cannot be generalized. In this paper, we propose a niched-penalty approach which does not require any penalty parameter. The penalty function creates a selective pressure towards the feasible region and a niching maintains diversity among feasible solutions for the genetic recombination operator to find new feasible solutions. The approach is only ap plicable to population-based approaches, thereby giving GAs (or other evolutionary algorithms) a niche in exploiting this penalty-parameter-less penalty approach.Simulation results on a number of constrained optimization problems suggest the efficacy of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are well-known to be well suited for multi-objective (MO) optimization. However, especially in the case of real-valued variables, classic domination-based approaches are known to lose selection pressure when approaching the Pareto set. Indicator-based approaches, such as optimizing the uncrowded hypervolume (UHV), can overcome this issue and ensure that individual solutions converge to the Pareto set. Recently, a gradient-based UHV algorithm, known as UHV-ADAM, was shown to be more efficient than (UHV-based) EAs if few local optima are present. Combining the two techniques could exploit synergies, i.e., the EA could be leveraged to avoid local optima while the efficiency of gradient algorithms could speed up convergence to the Pareto set. It is a priori however not clear what would be the best way to make such a combination. In this work, therefore, we study the use of a dynamic resource allocation scheme to create hybrid UHV-based algorithms. On several bi-objective benchmarks, we find that the hybrid algorithms produce similar or better results than the EA or gradient-based algorithm alone, even when finite differences are used to approximate gradients. The implementation of the hybrid algorithm is available at https://github.com/damyha/uncrowded-hypervolume.},

The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) is a relatively recent technique for finding or approximating the Pareto-optimal set for multiobjective optimization problems. In different studies SPEA has shown very good performance in comparison to other multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, and therefore it has been a point of reference in various recent investigations. Furthermore, it has been used in different applications. In this paper, an improved version, namely SPEA2, is proposed, which incorporates in contrast to its predecessor a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method. The comparison of SPEA2 with SPEA and two other modern elitist methods, PESA and NSGA-II, on different test problems yields promising results.Other

	abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are commonly applied to treat multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) due to their global nature, robustness, and reliability. However, it is also well known that MOEAs need quite a few resources to compute a good approximation of the Pareto set/front. Even more, MOEAs may exhibit difficulties when dealing with highly constrained search spaces. A possible remedy is the hybridization of MOEAs with specialized local search operators; if the local search is based on mathematical programming techniques, gradient information is needed, resulting in relatively high computational cost in many problem instances. In this work, we propose an effective way of computing multi-objective descent directions seeking a compromise between feasibility and the decrement in the objective function values. Moreover, we can obtain this direction so that we do not have to explicitly compute the gradients but extract this information in the best fit manner out of the current population of the MOEA. We demonstrate two hybrid methods, each focused on certain types of problems. Numerical results on some benchmark problems support the benefits of the novel approach.},
